9,Wish,1 action,Self,V,Instantaneous, Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloudyou can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires. The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spellincluding costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternativelyyou can create one of the following effects of your choice: ?? You create one object of up to 25000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimensionand it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground. ?? You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit pointsand you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell. ?? You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose. ?? You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instanceyou could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack. ?? You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For examplea wish spell could undo an opponent's successful savea foe's critical hitor a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantageand you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll. You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instancethe greater the wishthe greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply failthe effect you desire might only be partly achievedor you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For examplewishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer aliveeffectively removing you from the game. Similarlywishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stresseach time you cast a spell until you finish a long restyou take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In additionyour Strength drops to 3if it isn't 3 or lower alreadyfor 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activityyour remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finallythere is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.,Sorcerer
