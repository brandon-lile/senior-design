If you know a specific creature’s nameyou can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creaturethough you might get a different creature anyway (DM’s choice). When the creature appearsit is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for paymentbut it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasmor help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemiesor protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services. Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied templewhile a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.  As a rule of thumba task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1000 gp per hour. And a task m easured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s ethosthe payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested paymentwhile especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal. After the creature completes the taskor when the agreed-upon duration of service expiresthe creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to youif appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature’s servicethe creature immediately returns to its home plane.  A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of itreceiving a full share of experience points awarded.  ,Cleric
