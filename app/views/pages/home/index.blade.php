        <p>Dungeon Suave offers Campaign Crawler as an alternative to the tradition pencil and paper method of managing your
            Dungeons and Dragons campaigns.  The goal of this tool is to streamline the game so you can spend more time
            playing and less time writing, erasing, and shuffling through pages.</p>

        <p>Campagin Crawler gives your Dungeons and Dragons group a central location to store information about your
            campaign so you can keep group members up to date with meeting locations and times, and if you are unable
            meet for a few weeks you can look up the notes from your last meeting.</p>
